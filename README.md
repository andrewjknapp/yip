# yip
Have you ever wondered "Where should I eat tonight?". You ask your friends or partner where they would like to go, but they give the dreaded apathetic "I am happy with wherever". Yip is your solution. It is as simple as entering a city and boom, you get instant results for the best restaurants in your area. To refine your search you can enter type of cuisine (Italian, Mexican ...), type of establishment (Fast Food, Fine Dining...), or type of experience (Take Out, Dine in...). Each of these categories are drawn from available ones in your location so there is no worry about choosing a single category that does not exist. If however you choose a combination of categories that does not exist such as Sushi Pizzeria you will be told there are none of that type in your area.

That is Yip, let your indecisiveness plague your loved ones no longer. Enjoy the search. YIP
